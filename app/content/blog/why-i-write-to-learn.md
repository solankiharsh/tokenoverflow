I'm the kind of person who only really gets a concept when I have to explain it. So I write.

Writing forces me to structure the mess in my head. If I can't write it clearly, I probably don't understand it yet. That's why you'll find me turning internal docs into something readable, or turning a messy RAG pipeline into a short "here's what we did and why" post.

**No servers were harmed** in the making of this habit—just a lot of markdown and the occasional over-engineered diagram.

If you're the same way, you're in good company. Write the doc. Explain it to the rubber duck. Then ship.
